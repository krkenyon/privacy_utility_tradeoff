    "## Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The results show a clear privacy–utility trade-off across the 60 runs (20 tasks × 3 variants).\n",
    "\n",
    "On average, **original prompts** have a privacy score of 0.00 and the highest utility (\\~0.053), since they preserve all semantic and structural information. Applying **low obfuscation** (identifier renaming) increases privacy to \\~0.085 but reduces utility to \\~0.021, suggesting that model performance already depends on the specific identifier names used in the prompt. With **high obfuscation**, privacy rises further to \\~0.87 while utility drops close to zero (\\~0.0038), indicating that removing meaningful names, comments, and docstrings makes the prompt much less informative for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pearson correlation between privacy and utility over all 60 points is -0.31 (negative), reinforcing the observed trade-off.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scatter plot therefore exhibits a clear negative relationship between privacy and utility: as we make prompts more private by aggressively obfuscating them, the model’s completions share fewer n-grams with the canonical solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations.** This analysis uses a relatively small model and only the first 20 HumanEval test examples, so the absolute scores are low and may not generalise to larger models. In addition, ROUGE and character-level Levenshtein distance are only proxies for true functional correctness and privacy; two prompts with similar structure might still reveal sensitive semantics. Nevertheless, the experiment illustrates the qualitative trade-off that stronger obfuscation improves privacy at the cost of completion quality. Note that the low-obfuscation setting still leaks some semantic information via docstring examples (e.g. the original function name appears inside >>> lines), whereas the high-obfuscation setting removes these entirely. As a result, the privacy scores for low obfuscation reflect only identifier changes in code, not comment-level leakage.\n",
